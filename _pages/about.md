I am a third year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University. 
Working as a researcher in [PurNET](https://purnet-lab.gitlab.io) and [NextGArch](https://nextgarch.gitlab.io) labs, under the supervision of [Asst. Prof. Muhammad Shahbaz](https://mshahbaz.gitlab.io).
Before joining Purdue, I did my M.S. & B.Engg from NUST, Pakistan, after which I joined the industry ~4 years, working as a Malware Researcher, and then as Assistant Manager Cyber-Security. 

My research interests lie broadly in the areas of security and architectures, with a focus on Systems, Networks, and AI. Currently, I am developing NextGen architectural frameworks for distributed AI systems.
